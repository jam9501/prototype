In all transparency, this is a rough—— and first—— attempt at a Scrollama project. I used iframes to encode the graphics, and they ended up cutting off even with style dimension adjustments. I'm thinking of reworking the iframes with Adobe Illustrator for a more direct and efficent output. 

I coded the bar graph in Python, then stylized it afterwards. 

I used animated graphics for photos and artwork.
