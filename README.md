In all transparency, this is a rough—— and first—— attempt at a Scrollama project. I used iframes to encode the graphics, and they ended up cutting off even with style dimension adjustments. I'm thinking of reworking the iframes with Adobe Illustrator for a more direct and efficent output. 

Because data on presidential candidate and what tie knots they used was not readily available, I created my own dataset based off of archival footage and photos of presidential debates, etc. Theodore Roosevelt was the first presidential candidate to wear a traditional tie, so the data looks at canddates after 1908. I only included candidates post-primaries. 

The "testing.html" file displays all my graphics, but "tiescroll.html" is the scrollytelling attempt. 

I coded the bar graph in Python, then stylized it afterwards. 

I used animated graphics for photos and artwork.
